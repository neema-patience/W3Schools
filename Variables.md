# JavaScript Variables and Data Types

## Understanding Variables in JavaScript

JavaScript variables act as storage containers for data and can be declared in four ways:
- **Implicitly (Automatically)**
- Using `var`
- Using `let`
- Using `const`

### Implicit Declaration
```js
x = 5;
y = 6;
z = x + y;
```
> **Best Practice:** Always explicitly declare variables to avoid potential issues in code execution.

### Declaring Variables with `var`
```js
var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var z = x + y;
```
> **Note:** `var` was widely used before ES6 (2015) but is now considered outdated due to its function-scoped nature.

### Declaring Variables with `let`
```js
let x = 5;
let y = 6;
let z = x + y;
```
> **Note:** `let` provides block-level scoping, making it preferable for most use cases.

### Declaring Constants with `const`
```js
const x = 5;
const y = 6;
const z = x + y;
```
> **Note:** `const` is used for values that should not be reassigned after declaration.

### Mixed Variable Declaration Example
```js
const price1 = 5;
const price2 = 6;
let total = price1 + price2;
```
> **Guideline:** Use `const` when the value should remain unchanged and `let` when reassignment is required.

## Choosing Between `var`, `let`, and `const`
1. **Always declare variables explicitly** to prevent accidental global variables.
2. Use `const` when a variable’s value should remain constant.
3. Use `let` for variables that require reassignment.
4. Use `var` **only** if supporting older JavaScript environments.

## JavaScript Identifiers
Variable names in JavaScript:
- Can include letters, numbers, underscores (`_`), and dollar signs (`$`).
- Must start with a letter, `_`, or `$`.
- Are **case-sensitive** (`myVar` and `myvar` are distinct).
- Cannot use JavaScript reserved keywords (e.g., `let`, `function`).

## Assignment Operator (`=`) vs. Equality Operators (`==` and `===`)
The assignment operator `=` is used to assign values:
```js
x = x + 5;
```
For comparison:
- `==` checks for value equality, allowing type conversion.
- `===` checks for both value and type equality.

## JavaScript Data Types
JavaScript variables can store different types of values:

### Number and String Examples
```js
const pi = 3.14;
let person = "John Doe";
let answer = 'Yes, I am!';
```
> **Note:** Strings must be enclosed in either single or double quotes.

### Declaring Variables in JavaScript
```js
let carName = "Volvo";
```
Example within an HTML script:
```html
<p id="demo"></p>
<script>
let carName = "Volvo";
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = carName;
</script>
```

### Declaring Multiple Variables
```js
let person = "John Doe", carName = "Volvo", price = 200;
```
Or across multiple lines:
```js
let person = "John Doe";
let carName = "Volvo";
let price = 200;
```

## Understanding Undefined Variables
If a variable is declared but not initialized, it holds the value `undefined`:
```js
let carName;
console.log(carName); // undefined
```

## Re-declaring Variables
With `var`, variables can be re-declared without losing their initial value:
```js
var carName = "Volvo";
var carName;
console.log(carName); // "Volvo"
```
> **Important:** Variables declared with `let` or `const` cannot be re-declared within the same scope.

## JavaScript Arithmetic and Type Coercion
```js
let x = 5 + 2 + 3; // x = 10
let y = "5" + 2 + 3; // y = "523" (concatenation due to string precedence)
let z = 2 + 3 + "5"; // z = "55" (evaluates left-to-right)
```
> **Note:** If the first operand is a string, JavaScript treats subsequent additions as string concatenation.

## Special Characters in Variable Names
JavaScript allows `$` and `_` in identifiers:
```js
let $ = "Hello World";
let $$$ = 2;
let _lastName = "Johnson";
```
> **Usage:** `$` is commonly used in JavaScript libraries (e.g., jQuery), while `_` is often used for private variables.
